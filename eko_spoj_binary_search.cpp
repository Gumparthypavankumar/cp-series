    Problem link: https://www.spoj.com/problems/EKO/
    Approach: 
        Since the range from 0 to N is monotonic we can use Binary search
        NOTE: We are considering 0 since the trees can be cut from ground level
        For every H we need to check whether this H is less than or equal to Tree height because only then we can cut the tree
        mid is what we are passing as height in every iteration
